This repository is for NMC 245 Cultural Analytics and Data Science at Oregon State.
Each file provides resources that back a day of class. Generally, we don't use slide decks, so studnets are taking notes and running code. 
The course has four units: R basics (including Tidyverse core assets like ggplot2, dplyr, and the new pivot), network analysis (both in R and Gephi), and Natural Language processing focusing on sentiment analysis. Finally, students are expected to implement their final projects as Markdown files.
